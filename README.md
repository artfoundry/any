Any
===

Any is a game of strategy and luck that anyone can learn and play nearly anywhere.

Instructions
==

Units
-----
There are 3 types of units: Base, Defender, and Attacker.
Only units of Power 1 can be Base units, but any unit an be used for Defense or Attack.
Each player starts with one Base which is automatically placed on the field at the beginning, plus a Power 1 unit and a Power 2 unit in his Reserves.
New units are acquired at the beginning of each round.The number of units acquired is determined by the number of bases your opponent controls.
The Power of each acquired unit is determined by a die roll. You decide the maximum Power level, anywhere from 2 to 9, at the beginning of the game.

Turns
-----
Each round is made up of 2 phases, and each phase contains multiple steps.
Both players complete the first phase in turn before moving on to the second.
Both players complete the second phase in turn before starting a new round (if the game is not over).
Player 1 always gets the first turn for each phase. Going first can be beneficial in combat if you can destroy your opponent's bases in that turn.
However, going first in the placement phase can be detrimental because you do not know how your opponent will place his units.

Phase 1: Units.

Step 1: Acquisition.  Dice are automatically rolled to determine acquired unit's Power.
Step 2: Placement.  Units may be placed as Bases, Defenders, or Attackers.
Only Power 1 units may be placed as Bases.  Players may play none, some, or all units in their Reserves.

Phase 2: Combat.

Step 1: Attack.  Player may attack if he has Attack units.  Choose which units will attack.

Step 2: Defense.  Opposing player may defend if Defense units are available.
Player chooses which Defense units will defend and how they will be assigned.
Defense units may be assigned one to one or may team up to defend one attacking unit.
For any Attackers that are left undefended, an \!\ will appear in the Defending row, in the same column as the Attacker,
to indicate that that Attacker will destroy one of the defending player's Bases upon combat resolution.

Step 3: Attack focus.  If applicable, attacking player assigns how his undefended units will attack.
Undefended attackers may assist other defended Attackers or attack Base units (default is to attack Base units, one Attacker per Base.

Step 4: Reinforcements.  Defending player may add units in Reserves to Defending units to enhance their Power, but only to a maximum of 9.
For example, a Power 1 unit added to a Power 2 unit turns it into a Power 3 unit.
However, a Power 5 unit added to a Power 6 unit will only turn it into a Power 9 unit.  Reinforcements may NOT be removed later.
In response, the attacking player may do the same for his Attack units.
The attacking player may also permanently move any Defense units to attack.
However, for this round, these attackers may only assist other attackers in fighting the opponent's Defenders - 
they may not attack the bases.  The following round, they remain as attackers if they're still alive and attack normally.
Finally, the defending player may use his Base's Power-up ability if he has at least one unit currently defending and more than one Base.
For just this round, and only while he's defending,
all of his Bases power up to provide additional temporary power to one Defender equal to the number of Bases the player controls.
Once combat resolves the boost disappears.  Additionally, as a side effect, the defending player sacrifices one Base unit.
Thus, this ability will not be available if you have only one Base left.
Reinforcement step repeats, going back and forth until both players choose to pass.

Step 5: Combat resolution.  Damage is dealt to attacking, defending, and base units.  Damage is resolved in a basic Power value comparison.
Higher Power units survive while lower Power units are destroyed.  If both units are the same Power, both are destroyed.
Any base unit attacked is destroyed (and if its attacker is a Power level 1, it's destroyed as well).

Once a player's base units are gone, that player loses and the game ends.
